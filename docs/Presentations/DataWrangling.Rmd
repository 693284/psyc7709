### Data-wrangling text

Obtain a reasonably sized piece of text (at least 250 words or more) and load into R as a string variable

**Pre-processing**

 - convert all characters to lowercase, remove all punctuation, special characters,and numbers so the only characters left are the letters from a-z
 
**Analysis questions**

 - create a table with a letter frequency distribution (a count of how many times each letter appears in the text)
 - Letters appear in different positions of words. Create a table with letter frequency distrbibutions as a function of letter position in a word. For example, you will have a distribution for all first position letters, all 2nd position letters, and so on. Don't worry about going past 9 positions.
