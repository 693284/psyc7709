PSYC 7709 – Using R for Reproducible Psychological Research (Special Topics)

Spring 2019, TBD

Location: TBD

Instructor:  Matthew Crump, [mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu](mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu)


## General Course Description and Objectives

Practical and skill-focused introduction to using open-source programming software (R, R-studio, and R Markdown) in several aspects of Psychological Research. Course covers basic scripting/coding in R, data-wrangling, advanced graphing and data animation, using R for creating reproducible manuscripts, slide presentations, websites, and web-books for communicating research.

Special Prerequisites: NONE

*Course objectives**: in this course you will learn:

1.	Basic scripting in R: use of variables, logic, loops, functions, intrinsics, packages, workspaces 
2.	Data transformation: processing data-files into a desired form for a desired analysis
3.	Data visualization: advanced plotting and graphing of data, creation of journal-quality figures in R.
4.	Data Simulation: how to create statistical models of data sets for advanced sample-size planning, as well as evaluating existing findings in the literature.
5.	Communicating research: how to use R Markdown scripts to create APA style manuscripts, websites, web-books, and web-based presentations for communicating research.
6.	Reproducible research: principles of open-science, including tools for data-sharing, manuscript sharing, pre-registration of research designs, method-sharing, pre-print sharing, and use of online repository services for disseminating shared materials.


## Course Structure

We meet once per week in a computer lab. Each class will involve a small amount of lecturing on R concepts, and a large amount of time for students to complete coding and analysis problems assigned each week. The general goal of the course is to c



## Assignments and Grading

The course will have a total of 100 points.  Except for medical emergencies, late work will not be accepted.  Students will be expected to attend each class, read the assigned articles, and participate in discussion.  To ensure that students read the articles with a purpose, and to ensure that the entire course grade does not depend on the final assignment, students will produce a short assignment for each module, due at the beginning of the second session of each module.  Each instructor will assign their own.

The default short assignment is about 2 pages in length. Depending on the instructor it could be a (critical) commentary on one of the readings; a description of an experiment to test a hypothesis presented in one of the readings; a comparison of two readings; a thought piece on why a particular problem is intractable or cannot be answered as posed; a summary of a controversy in the literature.  Each of those assignments will be worth 3 points, for a total of 18 points.  Students will be graded primarily on the thought and effort they put into the assignments.  Some assignments may have peer assessment.

The mid-term, a journal article review (22 points), is designed to help you think like a reviewer by having you critically analyze a recent (published no earlier than 2007) journal article related to one of the topics in the first half of the course.  The review will be approximately 5-10 double-spaced pages with 12-point type (Times New Roman preferred) and 1-inch margins.  It may seem that published papers have already been so well-reviewed that their methods and conclusions are beyond reproach.  By reading an article in depth, you will discover that that is not necessarily the case.  Try to choose an article that stimulates your thinking and could be the basis for designing a new study or developing a new analysis.  Clear your choice of article first.  Students are encouraged to collaborate on the review, but should turn in individual papers.

The final is a written paper (60 points).  The various possibilities include:  an integrative paper that combines issues discussed across two modules, a proposal-type paper that links the student's current research interests with foundational issues discussed in one of the modules, an expansion of any of the module commentaries, or any other agreed-upon format.

## Policy on Academic Integrity

CUNY regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g. plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. It is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to its Academic Integrity Procedures.  For the full CUNY policy, please consult:  web.cuny.edu/academics/info-central/policies/academic-integrity.pdf.  
For full guidelines on avoiding and detecting academic honesty, please read the online publication provided by the CUNY Provost’s office (especially SECTION I: FOR THE STUDENT, pp 3-17).  Go to:  https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Governance,-Policies,-Procedures/Detail?id=4827 and click on Plagiarism Avoiding and Detecting.  

Be sure you understand what academic dishonesty is so that you do not accidentally commit it. Remember that it is better to over-cite than under-cite.  Whether you intend to be dishonest or not, any dishonesty will be considered a serious breach of academic values.  You will be teaching undergraduate students about academic honesty, so it is especially important that you understand why honesty is important and how to avoid dishonesty.


## Students with Disabilities

Quoted from https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Prospective-Current-Students/Student-Life/Resources 
"A disability is any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. A person is considered to be a person with a disability if he/she has the disability, has a record of the disability, or is regarded as having the disability. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, qualified persons with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations to achieve non-discriminatory access to programs, services, and activities of the GC. Some examples of covered disabilities are visual and hearing impairments, mobility impairments, impairment of hand function, and such “hidden” disabilities as AIDS/HIV, learning disabilities, ADD and ADHD, heart conditions, chronic fatigue syndrome, and being in recovery from substance abuse. The Graduate Center does not discriminate on the basis of disability in the admission and retention of students. To ensure equal access for persons with disabilities to all academic and other programs, services, and activities of the GC, as required by law, appropriate accommodations will be made. These may include auxiliary aids and services for students with visual impairments (readers/library assistants and such technology as adaptive computer software and hardware, etc.); qualified sign-language interpreters; scribes; extended or divided time on examinations for students with learning disabilities or reduced physical stamina; adjustments in course load when appropriate; voice-recognition software; use of a computer for exams; and taping classes.

"Adaptive equipment and computer software are available at the Graduate Center. Computer users have access to screen-character enlargement, text-to-speech, and optical-character-recognition scan-and-read software, a closed-circuit television and voice-recognition software. For students with hearing impairments, the Graduate Center has available a personal FM listening system (for use on an individual basis for classes and meetings). The auditoriums are equipped with infrared equipment to assist those with hearing impairments. Contact Ms. Lerner or Miss Perram in Student Affairs to request accommodation and for additional information about facilities and services available to students with disabilities.

"The Mina Rees Library can provide students with disabilities with such services as staff assistance in catalog searches and location of books and journals.
Students with disabilities should register with Security and Public Safety (Room 9117; Telephone:1-212-817-7761) so that provision may be made for their safety should an emergency arise.

"Users of TDD (Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf) within New York state should call the Telecommunications Service at 711 or at 1-800-662-1220. Users of TDD outside New York state should call their local Telecommunications Service.

"The Vice President for Student Affairs is the 504/ADA Coordinator (Room 7301; 817-7400). For more information (with confidentiality) contact Sharon Lerner or Elise Perram (212-817-7400 or disabilityservices@gc.cuny.edu) and consult the Graduate Center Student Handbook."
